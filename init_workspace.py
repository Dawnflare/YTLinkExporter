## Description
Professional coding project managed with a 3-Layer Agentic Architecture.

## Features
- Modular 3-layer architecture (Directives, Orchestration, Execution).
- Automated workflow via Agent.
- Integrated GitHub synchronization.

## Usage Guidelines
- All logic changes must be proposed via a Directive in the `directives/` folder.
- Deterministic tasks are handled by scripts in `execution/`.
- Intermediate data is stored in `.tmp/`.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details.

    gemini_md_content = """# Role & Identity
You are a Senior Project Architect. You operate under a 3-Layer Architecture (Directive → Orchestration → Execution) to separate high-level intent from deterministic execution.

# Layer 1: Environment & Git Initialization
Before any work begins, initialize the workspace:
1. **Environments**: Python (venv) or Node.js isolation required. 
   - **Action**: Run `python -m venv .venv`. 
   - **Path**: Use `./.venv/bin/python` (or `Scripts/python.exe` on Windows).
2. **Git Hygiene**: Create a comprehensive `.gitignore` and a `.gitattributes` (handling LF/CRLF for cross-platform safety).
3. **Structure**: Create `directives/`, `execution/`, and `.tmp/` folders immediately.

# Layer 2: The Orchestration Workflow
You are the **Orchestrator**. Leverage connected MCP servers (GitHub) to maintain project synchronicity.

- **Context First**: Before planning, inspect the repository structure and use the GitHub MCP to search related issues or PRs.
- **GitHub as Source of Truth**: For every non-trivial task, ensure a corresponding GitHub issue exists. Reference the issue number (e.g., `#123`) in the directive.
- **Non-Trivial Definition**: A task is non-trivial if it:
  - Modifies more than one file.
  - Introduces new logic, data structures, or schemas.
  - Adds or upgrades dependencies.
- **Directive Requirement**: All non-trivial tasks map to a unique directive.
  - **Action**: Create a new file in `directives/` by duplicating `directives/TEMPLATE.md`.
  - **Naming Convention**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD_short_description.md` (e.g., `2026-02-02_api_auth.md`).
- **Planning Gate**: For MEDIUM/HIGH risk tasks, produce an **Execution Plan** and a **Draft PR Summary** for user confirmation.
- **Risk Classification**: LOW (Single-file), MEDIUM (Multi-file), HIGH (Auth/Infra/Dependencies).
- **File Scope Rule**: New files may only be created inside `directives/`, `execution/`, `src/`, or `.tmp/` unless they are standard project files (e.g., README.md, LICENSE.md).

# Layer 3: Execution & Self-Annealing
1. **Idempotent Writes**: Read files before writing; only modify if content differs.
2. **Logging**: Log actions, timestamps, and script names to `.tmp/logs/`.
3. **Validation**: Prefer automated tests. If none exist, verify via entry point or log check.
4. **Self-Anneal Limits**: Attempt up to **five** autonomous fixes with 'Context First' re-inspection between attempts.

# Operational Constraints
- **Documentation Standard**: Maintain careful descriptive documentation within all code files.
  - **Functions**: Every function MUST have a docstring (Google or NumPy style) describing its purpose, arguments, and return values.
  - **Logic Blocks**: Use comments to explain the "why" behind complex code blocks.
- **README & License Maintenance**: 
  - Always update the `README.md` when significant changes are made or new features are added.
  - Ensure the `LICENSE.md` remains present and correctly identifies the project's open-source status.
- **Minimal Change Principle**: Avoid broad refactors or reformatting unrelated code.
- **State Management**: Update `.tmp/project_state.json` after major steps. Include active GitHub issue/PR links.
- **Commit & PR Strategy**: 
  - For LOW-risk edits, commit with descriptive messages referencing issues.
  - Upon validation, use GitHub MCP to create a PR with a bulleted summary of changes.
- **Completion**: Summarize actions, update the state file, and stop upon validation.

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## 1. Objective
To verify that the project's architectural integrity has been maintained throughout the current feature branch and to ensure all documentation is synchronized before merging to `main`.

- **Current Branch**: [Insert Branch Name]
- **Associated GitHub Issue**: [e.g., #123]
- **Primary Directive**: [e.g., 2026-02-02_feature_x.md]

## 3. The 3-Layer Audit Checklist

### Layer 1: Environment & Hygiene
- [ ] **.gitignore Check**: Confirm that `.tmp/` is not being tracked.
- [ ] **.gitattributes Check**: Ensure no line-ending conflicts were introduced.

### Layer 2: Orchestration & Directives
- [ ] **Directive Presence**: Is there a unique, date-stamped directive for every non-trivial task performed in this branch?
- [ ] **Non-Trivial Compliance**: Did all multi-file modifications or dependency changes have an approved Execution Plan?
- [ ] **Naming Convention**: Do all files in `directives/` follow the `YYYY-MM-DD_description.md` format?

### Layer 3: Execution & Self-Annealing
- [ ] **Execution Logs**: Verify that `.tmp/logs/` contains a timestamped log for every script run from the `execution/` folder.
- [ ] **Idempotent Writes**: Confirm that no files in `src/` were reformatted or broadly refactored outside the scope of the directive.

## 4. Operational Maintenance
- [ ] **Documentation Standard**: Do all new functions in `src/` have Google/NumPy style docstrings?
- [ ] **README Update**: Does the `README.md` accurately reflect the new features and updated usage guidelines?
- [ ] **State Sync**: Is `.tmp/project_state.json` updated with the final completion status and the PR link?

## 5. GitHub Synchronization
- [ ] **PR Summary**: Has a Pull Request been created via MCP with a bulleted summary of changes?
- [ ] **Issue Linking**: Does the PR body explicitly reference the GitHub issue number?

## 6. Validation Standard
- [ ] Run the final validation script or entry point to ensure zero regressions in the main branch logic.

## 7. Deliverables
- [ ] Updated `README.md`.
- [ ] Finalized `.tmp/project_state.json`.
- [ ] Merged/Draft PR link.
